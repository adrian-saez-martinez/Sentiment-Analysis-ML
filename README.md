# Sentiment-Analysis-ML
This project is all about teaching a computer to read and understand text like a human would. It can figure out if the text sounds happy, sad, or something in between. It's like giving the computer a feeling! This can help us better understand how people are expressing themselves in things like online comments or reviews.
